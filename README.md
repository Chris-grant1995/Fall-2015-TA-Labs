# Fall-2015-TA-Labs

These are the lab assignments that I helped CS 0007 (Intro To Java) Students with during the Fall of 2015. 
Included in these files are the assignments, the solutions, and the files that I gave to students to help
complete the lab, if applicable. 

(Sidenote, overall I found this semester's labs way too hard for intro level CS students to be expected to complete,
this concern has been noted with Pitt's CS Department.)
